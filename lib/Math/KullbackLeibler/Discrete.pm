=head1 NAME

Math::KullbackLeibler::Discrete - Computes Kullback-Leibler divergence for two discrete distributes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module computes Kullback-Leibler divergence for two discrete
distributions, using smoothing.

    use Math::KullbackLeibler::Discrete;

    my $P = { a => 1/2, b => 1/4, c => 1/4 };
    my $Q = { a => 7/12, b => 2/12, d => 3/12 };

    my $kl = kl( $P, $Q );

    # optionally set the smoothing epsilon
    my $kl2 = kl( $P, $Q, epsilon => 0.0001 );

    # setting epsilon to 0 results in no smoothing.
    my $kl3 = kl( $P, $Q, epsilon => 0 );

=head1 EXPORT

=head2 kl

Computes smoothed KL.

Receives two mandatory arguments: two anonymous hashrefs, that map
events to their probabilities.

Implementation based on the description presented at
L<http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elhadad/nlp09/KL.html>.

The smoothing amount can be specified as parameter:

   kl( $P, $Q, epsilon => 0.001 );

This makes it possible to turn of smoothing, defined epsilon as
zero. However, notice that this will lead to errors in case of
divergent domains.

sub kl {
    my ($P, $Q, %opts) = @_;

    my $eps = 0.00001;

    $eps = $opts{epsilon} if exists $opts{epsilon};

    # Universe
    my $SU = {};
    $SU->{$_}++ for (keys %$P, keys %$Q);

    # | Universe - P |
    my $susp = scalar(keys %$SU) - scalar(keys %$P);

    # | Universe - Q |
    my $susq = scalar(keys %$SU) - scalar(keys %$Q);

    my $pc = $eps * ($susp/scalar(keys %$P));
    my $qc = $eps * ($susq/scalar(keys %$Q));

    my $Pline = sub {
        my $i = shift;
        return exists($P->{$i}) ? $P->{$i} - $pc : $eps;
    };
    my $Qline = sub {
        my $i = shift;
        return exists($Q->{$i}) ? $Q->{$i} - $qc : $eps;
    };

    my $kl = 0;
    for (keys %$SU) {
        $kl += $Pline->($_) * log($Pline->($_) / $Qline->($_));

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to Michael Elhadad for making his lecture on-line, so I found a
nice and clean explanation of how this metric could be computed and
implemented.
